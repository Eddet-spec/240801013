
Q1) Coders here is a simple task for you, you have given an array of size N and an integer M.
Your task is to calculate the difference between maximum sum and minimum sum of N-M
elements of the given array.
Constraints:
1<=t<=10
1<=n<=1000
1<=a[i]<=1000
Input Format:
First line contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases.
First line of every testcase contains two integer N and M.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array
Output:
For every test case print your answer in new line
Sample Input
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output
4
Explanation
M is 1 and N is 5 so you have to calculate maximum and minimum sum using (5-1 =) 4
elements.
Maximum sum using the 4 elements would be (2+3+4+5=)14.
Minimum sum using the 4 elements would be (1+2+3+4=)10.
Difference will be 14-10=4.

OUTPUT:


Q2) A new deadly virus has infected large population of a planet. A brilliant scientist has
discovered a new strain of virus which can cure this disease. Vaccine produced from this
virus has various strength depending on midichlorians count. A person is cured only if
midichlorians count in vaccine batch is more than midichlorians count of person. A doctor
receives a new set of report which contains midichlorians count of each infected patient,
Practo stores all vaccine doctor has and their midichlorians count. You need to determine
if doctor can save all patients with the vaccines he has. The number of vaccines and
patients are equal.
Input Format
First line contains the number of vaccines - N. Second line contains N integers, which are
strength of vaccines. Third line contains N integers, which are midichlorians count of
patients.
Output Format
Print a single line containing 'Yes' or 'No'.
Input Constraint
1 < N < 10
Strength of vaccines and midichlorians count of patients fit in integer.
Sample Input
5
123 146 454 542 456
100 328 248 689 200
Sample Output
No

Q3) You are given an array of n integer numbers a1, a2, . . . , an. Calculate the number of pair
of indices (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and ai xor aj = 0.
Input format
- First line: n denoting the number of array elements
- Second line: n space separated integers a1, a2, . . . , an.
Output format
Output the required number of pairs.
Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
1 ≤ ai ≤ 109
Sample Input
5
1 3 1 4 3
Sample Output
2
Explanation
The 2 pair of indices are (1, 3) and (2,5).
Code:

OUTPUT:


Q4) You are given an array A of non-negative integers of size m. Your task is to sort the array
in nondecreasing order and print out the original indices of the new sorted array.
Example:
A={4,5,3,7,1}
After sorting the new array becomes A={1,3,4,5,7}.
The required output should be "4 2 0 1 3"
Input Format:
The first line of input consists of the size of the array
The next line consists of the array of size m
Output Format:
Output consists of a single line of integers
Constraints:
1<=m<=106
0<=A[i]<=106
NOTE: The indexing of the array starts with 0.
Sample Input
5
4 5 3 7 1
Sample Output
4 2 0 1 3
Code:

OUTPUT:
